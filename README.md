# CSC51073 : Image Analysis and Computer Vision final project
Color-matching algorithms inspired by professional color grading workflows
By Rodrigue BATH & Jules GOUESLARD

## packages required for the project
- numpy
- cv2
- colour
- Pytorch
- scipy
- skimage
- sklearn
- matplotlib

## code organization

- main.ipynb is where you want to take a look first. This python lab file contains a full demo on how to use the code and what is possible with our code.

- color_transfer.py is the main file that contains the main method to apply every type of color transfer we implemented. It also contains the method to color correct the skin. A lot of python files from the project contains a specific method to transfer the color but they are all accessible from this method. This method also allows to choose a level of intensity for the color correction and to export a lut of the output result.

- lut_generation.py handles the lut export

- visualize.py contains all methods related to color and image visualization. These methods are useful to monitor the changes made to our images.

- util.py contains a few useful methods. It contains all the skin segmentation functions too.

- in the img folder, you can find plenty good examples of source/reference images for the tests and a few masks pre-generated by SAMv2.

Thank you
